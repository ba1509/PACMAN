# PACMAN
Develop a replica of the Pacman game using Object-oriented concepts and the Pygame package
. 
Implement a Breadth first search algorithm and Dijkstra for the ghosts to follow Pacman

Implement a joystick control to control movement of Pacman

Use of Array data structure for the background and to prevent Pacman and the ghosts from  colliding with the wall.


The code still needs a few minor finu tuning for it to work well.
